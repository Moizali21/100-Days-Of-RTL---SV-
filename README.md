# 100-Days-Of-RTL---SV-
I am using System Verilog Language  
# **Different Components of Processor**
## Introduction:
- **Systemverilog** SystemVerilog, standardized as IEEE 1800, is a hardware description and hardware verification language used to model, design, simulate, test and implement electronic systems. SystemVerilog is based on Verilog and some extensions, and since 2008 Verilog is now part of the same IEEE standard.- **RISCV** is an open source software standard instruction set architecture (ISA) that has originally designed to support computer architecture research and education.
